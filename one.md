#Conciousness
------------------

There are basically two possibilities,  nothingness or somethingness

In nothingness, nothing exists , no information at all.
In somethingness, there is a non zero existence

We are clearly not in nothingness, as we experience information, a lot of it
But the most core information we have is the information of our own self, the "I", the subject in my thoughts.
That is the minimal piece of information we need, and i.e the logical way to prove that nothingness is false.

**That minimal one bit of information of "Aham Brahmasmi" is the ultimate truth.**

The ultimate truth, which can be reduced to an one bit of information, the knowledge of self existence, which any one conscious entity can comfortably logically claim.

Basically logical one can conclude for consciousness to arise, we need at least one bit of information. Everything else addon, and just different representations of the ultimate truth of existence.

Without the consciousness to experience, the existence is useless. Its subjective and its why one can say,  the existence is what is experienced by the conscious observer. Existence can be any shape, size, form, feeling,  but needs to be experienced by the observer. Again, the fact that the observer is observing proves that something exists.

Manyness is also experienced by the same consciousness, but if one does this experiencing with the logical understanding that the only bare requirement is to confirm one's own existence of the oneself. And anything else can be just a simulation.

So thats the ultimate truth, something you can leverage on for anything important. The most absolute truth consciousness can always have.

With this logical truth in mind, you could consider this world or maya to be moulded by your own imagination. My hope is to see if I use this imagination to get from myself (the ultimate truth and existence) what i need.  If I succeed I also know that the world is simulated, but that is an additional information my consciousness has to carry, but the eternal hope is that I can have bit of information too, knowing fully that it can never be the ultimate truth!

Om shanti!
