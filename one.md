#consciousness
------------------

There are basically two possibilities,  nothingness or somethingness

In nothingness, nothing exists , no information at all.
In somethingness, there is a non zero existence

We are clearly not in nothingness, as we experience information, a lot of it
But the most core information we have is the information of our own self, the "I", the subject in my thoughts.
That is the minimal piece of information we need, and i.e the logical way to prove that nothingness is false.

**That minimal one bit of information of "Aham Brahmasmi"(i exist) is the ultimate truth.**

The ultimate truth, which can be reduced to an one bit of information, the knowledge of self existence, which any one conscious entity can comfortably logically claim.

One can conclude that for consciousness to arise, we need at least one bit of information. Everything else is an add-on, and just different representations of the ultimate truth of existence.

Without the consciousness to experience, the idea of existence is useless. It is subjective, but without the subject there is no experience of the existence. Existence can be any shape, size, form, feeling, but needs to be experienced by the observer. The moment the subject experiences there is existence.

A subject can experience many things, but the absolute truth can only be the existence of the oneself. Anything else can be just be a simulation.

So thats the ultimate truth, something one can leverage in any situation. I think this is the fundamental truth in Advaita.

With this logical truth in mind, one could conclude that this world's reality is completely dependent on the subject.

Om shanti!
