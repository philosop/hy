## Second take

It was pointed that my understanding of the message was wrong. 

The self (Aham) is aware of itself only in Jagrat, or in the current worldly form. The feeling of Aham is an innate feature of 
being in this world. Evertyhing depends on one having that feeling of existence. But Advaita goes and compares that state to 
the state of the self while one is dreaming. In the dreaming state, there is still the subject. But once we wake up from the 
dream we know that the observer is the same and that the observed (dream) was just an illusion. 
Also an interesting aspect is that, in dreams one does not use the sensory oragans. The experience however is just as real while 
you are dreaming as you are when you  awake and are using your sensory organs (Jagrat). Infact Advaita says that it is the 
desires that you have that are manifested as dreams. They are just a thought that gets manifested as real in the dreams. For e.g 
you dream of a car in your Jagrat, and you might see a dream where you are driving one. Aham (you) is the one which is experiencing 
both.

Contrast all this to the state of sleep, where you are not dreaming. Where does the I (Aham) go in that state? There is no 
awareness of oneself in that state. It merely is the state of lack of knowledge of existence. But when you wake from it, you know 
that you existed. It is only then you can know of your existence, and conclude that for the period of time you were sleeping.
