## Second take

It was pointed that my understanding of the advaita's message was wrong(as expected). 

Before we begin, there are few terminology to be familiar with 
Jagrat: The state when a person is awake (not sleeping)
Swapna: The state one is in, while dreaming in sleep
Shusupti: The state one is in, while sleeping and with no dreams
Aham: The Subjet or Observer or Self

The self (Aham) is aware of itself  in Jagrat. The feeling of Aham is an innate feature of being in this world. Evertyhing depends on one having that feeling of existence. Advaita compares that state to the state of the self while one is dreaming (swapna state). In the dreaming state, there is still a subject. But once we wake up from the dream we know that the observer/subject is the same and that the observed (dream) was just an illusion. 

Also an interesting aspect is that, in dreams one does not use the sensory oragans. The experience however is just as real while
you are dreaming as you are when youare awake and are using your sensory organs (Jagrat). Infact Advaita says that it is the desires that you have that are manifested as dreams. They are just a thought that gets manifested as real in the dreams. 
For e.g you dream of a car in your Jagrat, and you might see a dream where you are driving one. Aham (you) is the one which is experiencing both.

Contrast all this to the state of sleep, where you are not dreaming. Where does the I (Aham) go in that state? There is no 
awareness of oneself in that state. It merely is the state of lack of knowledge of existence. But when you wake from it, you know that you existed. It is only when you wake up you can assert your existence for the period of time you were sleeping. 

Because these states exists in one's own subjective experiences, one can logically conclude the possibility of the unrealness of the experiences (dream state being the example). One is also able to figure out that the lack of awareness of self, does not always implies non-existence, because we wake out of a sound sleep to an awareness state. In shushupti, an obesrver is not experiencing anything or is also not aware of itself, a pure state according to Advaitis. This state is what is akin to state of oneness. 

Just like dreams are a manifestation of one's desires, Jagrat (the current reality) is also a manifestation of one's desires or in other words the result of Karma. So when the desires are all quenched by experiencing them to the maximum satisfaction of the observer, there is no more experiencing. You (the entity) would then have no need for an existential state of Jagrat, or in otherwords you would attain moksha,  freedom from illusions of Jagrat. This apparently is similar to the sleep state, where if one does not have a desire, there is no dream. 

Questions
-------
1. How is sushupti different from nothingness? i.e while you are in sushupti, you are not aware of yourself or anyting at all. There is no experience to be had, not even a single bit of information (see [this](one.md)).
