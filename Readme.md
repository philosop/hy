##About

I think I have found an explanation for Advaita philosophy for myself to logically accept the idea. Since my knowledge of logic is limited by the little piece of meat I carry inside my head and its imaginative powers, I would like to have someone point at their's or someone else's ideas that logically contradicts my conclusions.

I also welcome the correct interpretation of Advaita if what I concluded that it says is incorrect.
