##About

I think I have found a comfortable explanation for Advaita philosophy for myself to believe in it. Since my knowledge of logic
is limited by the little piece of meat I carry inside my head and its imaginitive powers, I would like to have someone point at
their's or someone else's ideas that logically contradicts my conclusions.
